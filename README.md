#  GUI Image Classifier


## Description

A graphical user interface (GUI) application for image classification  This application uses TensorFlow and Keras to load a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify objects in images. Users can upload their images through the GUI and obtain predictions about the contents of those images. The application displays the top prediction along with its probability, allowing users to interactively test the model's performance on different images.

## Key Features

- Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for image classification.
- User-friendly GUI interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
- Displays the top prediction and its probability for the uploaded image.
- Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Taipy for the GUI.
